We cut costs and boosted response times by transitioning payment services to a serverless setup. Ensuring robust security for money transfers via code reviews, I managed Lambda functions and implemented SQS for efficient cash transfer updates across channels. I also set up SNS for automated customer notifications and streamlined build monitoring using Jenkins and Bitbucket CI/CD workflows. Created high coverage unit tests to reduce production issues.
